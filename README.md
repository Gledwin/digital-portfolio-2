# Introduction 

This digital portfolio is a reflection of the skills, knowledge, and experiences I have gained during the **Work Readiness Training** program. It includes both **evidence of participation** and **reflections** written using the **STAR Technique** (Situation, Task, Action, Result), aimed at demonstrating my readiness for the professional environment.

The portfolio is organized into the following key sections:

- **Interview Skills**
- **Mock Interview**
- **Professional Networking**
- **Workplace Etiquette**

# Business Communication and Workplace Etiquette

The evidence demostrates my participation in the communication and documentation aspects of the WIL project, which align with the Business Communication and Workplace Etiquette criteria for the digital portfolio.

## For the Business Communication

As an individual working on my own business idea and its technical solution, I was responsible for communicating the project's strategy and progress to my supervisors. My task was to clearly articulate the complex details of my concept and regularly report my individual progress to stay on track. To achieve this, I created formal documents, such as the Business Profile and Brand Strategy, which served as the official written communication of my core plan. Additionally, I used the Daily Stand-up to provide concise, professional verbal updates on my progress and any individual challenges. 
This clear, dual-approach communication ensured that all supervisors were aligned with my project goals, allowing me to manage expectations and quickly receive feedback, which helped me efficiently build my tech solution.
