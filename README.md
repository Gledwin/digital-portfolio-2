# Introduction 

This digital portfolio is a reflection of the skills, knowledge, and experiences I have gained during the **Work Readiness Training** program.

## For the Business Communication

As an individual working on my own business idea and its technical solution, I was responsible for communicating the project's strategy and progress to my supervisors. My task was to clearly articulate the complex details of my concept and regularly report my individual progress to stay on track. To achieve this, I created formal documents, such as the Business Profile and Brand Strategy, which served as the official written communication of my core plan. Additionally, I used the Daily Stand-up to provide concise, professional verbal updates on my progress and any individual challenges. 
This clear, dual-approach communication ensured that all supervisors were aligned with my project goals, allowing me to manage expectations and quickly receive feedback, which helped me efficiently build my tech solution.

Reflection: STAR technique

- Situation - As an individual working on my business idea and technical solution, I was solely responsible for communicating my project's vision, strategy, and progress to the Project Manager and any involved facilitators.

- Task - I needed to clearly articulate the complex details of my business idea (e.g., brand and research) in a professional format, and regularly report my individual progress to ensure I stayed on track.
  
- Action - I created formal, detailed documents, such as the Business Profile and Brand Strategy, which clearly communicated my core strategy in writing. I used the Daily Stand-up to provide concise, professional updates on my individual progress and any personal blockers.
  
- Result - The clear, documented strategy ensured that all supervisors were aligned with my project goals. My effective communication during stand-ups allowed me to manage expectations and quickly get feedback, helping me efficiently build my tech solution.


## For Workplace Etiquestte 

My individual project required me to follow professional protocols, which meant I needed to demonstrate strong professional conduct by being reliable, using official communication channels, and keeping all my documentation highly organized. I ensured I was always on time for the mandatory Daily Stand-up and any scheduled check-ins, showing respect for the administrator's time. For all communication, I exclusively used official platforms like Teams and CPUT email. Furthermore, I maintained a highly organized file system with clear naming for documents like the Research Strategy (artefact). My consistent punctuality and adherence to these channels ensured I did not disrupt the project flow for others, and my overall professional conduct showed I am ready to operate reliably and independently in a supervised, professional environment.

Reflection: STAR technique

- Situation - My individual project required me to follow professional protocols, including timely reporting and proper documentation, as expected in a supervised academic/work setting.
- Task - I needed to demonstrate strong professional conduct by being reliable, using official communication channels, and keeping all my individual project documentation organized 
- Action - I ensured I was always on time for the mandatory Daily Stand-up and any scheduled check-ins. I exclusively used official platforms like Teams and CPUT email for all communication. Furthermore, I maintained an organized file system with clear names for all my documents (artefact), showing respect for the administrator's review time.
- Result - My consistent punctuality and adherence to official channels ensured I did not disrupt the project flow for others. My professional conduct showed I am ready to operate reliably and independently in a supervised, professional environment.

# 2. Interview Skills

The primary evidence for my Interview Skills is the successful completion of the required formative assessments on the learning management system. I achieved a perfect score on both required tasks:

 - Interview Skills Assessment: 100/100

 - 1 Interview Skills - Interview Skills Assessment: 100/100

These scores validate my knowledge of effective interview preparation, response strategies, and professional conduct during the interview process, demonstrating I've mastered the theoretical skills covered in the work readiness training.
 

Reflection: STAR technique

- Situation - During the Work Readiness Training, I completed the unit focused on effective Interview Skills, which required me to understand and apply best practices for job interviews.
  
- Task - My task was to successfully master the material, including preparing answers, understanding interviewer expectations, and learning how to professionally close an interview.

- Action - I thoroughly studied the course content and applied that knowledge while attempting the two required assessments. I focused on correctly identifying key strategies for behavioral questions and professional follow-up.

- Result - I achieved a score of 100/100 on both assessments (artefact). This result proves I have a strong theoretical foundation in Interview Skills, which is essential for successfully securing opportunities in the ICT industry.

# 3. Mock Inteview

Reflection: STAR technique

- Situation - As part of the Work Readiness training, I was required to participate in a simulated job interview (Mock Interview) to practice my communication and behavioral skills under pressure.

- Task - My task was to successfully apply all the theoretical Interview Skills I had learned, specifically focusing on clearly answering behavioral questions using a structured technique like STAR, and maintaining professional conduct.

- Action - I prepared for the mock interview by researching common industry questions and structuring my answers. During the recorded interview (artefact), I focused on articulating my skills and experience clearly, maintaining strong eye contact, and presenting a professional demeanor throughout the session.

- Result - The mock interview allowed me to identify areas where I was strong (e.g., confidence, knowledge) and areas for improvement (e.g., the clarity of specific examples). This experience provided crucial practical exposure, greatly increasing my confidence and preparedness for real-world job interviews.

# 4. Prefessional Networking

The key evidence for my professional networking is my active and established presence on LinkedIn, the leading platform for career development. The screenshot of my profile (artefact) shows I have established a professional online presence, listing my current status as an ICT student at Cape Peninsula University of Technology. It also shows I have 17 connections, which demonstrates the start of my professional network building.

Reflection: STAR technique

- Situation - The Work Readiness training emphasized the critical need for ICT professionals to build and maintain a strong professional network for career growth and job opportunities.

- Task - My task was to establish a formal, professional online presence and begin actively networking with peers, mentors, and industry professionals.

- Action - I created and optimized my LinkedIn profile (artefact), ensuring all details about my education and skills were accurate. I then proactively started connecting with classmates, lecturers, and individuals in the ICT industry, resulting in 17 connections (artefact) as a foundation for my network.

- Result - I successfully established the required professional network foundation. This resource now serves as my primary tool for industry research, job searching, and connecting with future employers, ensuring I am well-positioned to leverage opportunities in the job market.
